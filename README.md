# MongoDb-Start-On-Window-10
# This happened probably because the MongoDB service isn't started. Follow the below steps to start it:

    # 1.Go to Control Panel and click on Administrative Tools.
    # 2.Double click on Services. A new window opens up.
    # 3.Search MongoDB.exe. Right click on it and select Start.

The server will start. Now execute npm start again and the code might work this time.
