mongodb start on window-10 


This happened probably because the MongoDB service isn't started. Follow the below steps to start it:

    Go to Control Panel and click on Administrative Tools.
    Double click on Services. A new window opens up.
    Search MongoDB.exe. Right click on it and select Start.

The server will start. Now execute npm start again and the code might work this time.
